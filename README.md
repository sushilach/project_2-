The program aims to simulate the matching process within a dating application, demonstrating the complexity of determining compatibility while considering the nuanced nature of individual preferences and potential mismatches in mutual interest.
The algorithm considers mutual preferences between users to rank potential matches in order of compatibility. However, it introduces a twist by acknowledging that someone's top choice might not reciprocate their interest, leading to the need for a secondary list of potential matches who might be interested in the user despite not being their primary choice.
